      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>My name is Mindy, currently a senior at NYU doing Computer Science and Data Science with minor in Economics and Business Entertainment Media and Technology.</p>
      <p>I love going to the gym, cook, drink, paint, and hanging out with friends. During weekend, I love hanging out at the park or museums because</p>
      <p>the park has cute dogs, trees, and cute babies. I also love museum because of art </p>
      <p>Occassionally clubs too because there is music, drinks, and my friends. </p>

    <p>
        Currently on campus, I am engaged in two main clubs: Taiwanese American Student Society and Data Science Club. Feel free to ask
        me any questions regarding these two clubs or the events we are hosting this semester. 
        I am leaving New York City end of the summer to move to LA for my job, but I am not certain on what I want to do in my life yet. 
        I am super extroverted and love meeting new people, please do say hi to me. 
        </p>
